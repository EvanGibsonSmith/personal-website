            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Sidestepping the philosophic question, am I a third-year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. I am working toward a combined Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. On the Computer Science side, I'm very interested in deep learning and algorithms in general, while on the Electrical and Computer Engineering side, I focus on analog design. I also enjoy exploring audio applications in this field.</p>
<p>On campus I am a treasurer for the WPI Chapter of Eta Kappa Nu and am the Web Secretary for Upsilon Pi Epsilon. I am on the High Powered Rocketry Club on the Electronics Design Team working on a new PCB to gather and store sensory data for this year's rocket. I also play piano in the Jazz Ensemble.</p>
<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, whitewater kayaking, and canoeing. I'm from Maine, so the picture on the homepage of this website is of Mount Katahdin from Mount Deasey. I really enjoy working on projects when I have the time (I currently have a pretty large backlog). These are not limited to the ones linked on this website, as not all of them make good write ups.</p>
<h5>Contact Info</h5>
<p>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:evangibsonsmith@gmail.com">evangibsonsmith@gmail.com</a>!<br>
My LinkedIn profile can be found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangibsonsmith/">here</a>, although I keep most of my notable work on this site.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I spent my time over COVID looking into claims about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp">technical analysis</a> in the stock market, and it particular the &quot;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverseheadandshoulders.asp">Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern</a>.&quot; It was very insightful, and I found some fascinating correlations, but the results ended up being very sprawling and mostly found (unsurprisingly) that it doesn't work that well. This is also how I was introduced to deep learning and neural networks. In general, I really enjoy small data analysis projects, such as looking at statistics for hockey goalies in the NHL (because my brother plays goalie in hockey). I may add a page for both of these projects in the future if I have time to reorganize everything into a digestible format. Over COVID I also built a climbing wall (or more aptly, a climbing &quot;hut&quot;, since it had a roof) in our backyard with the help of my parents.</p>

<div class="note">Comparing the "slope" downward of a particular Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern to the direction of the stock a few candlesticks after. The bandwidth represents the relative size of the pattern. More information on what is mostly a decorative graph for the moment will be in a future write up. </div>
<h5>Class Projects</h5>
<p>Aside from some of the projects I've done for clubs and outside of class, I have some other projects from some of the classes I've taken.</p>
<p>The largest of these was for the Software Engineering class at WPI, which involved using AWS Lambda and SQL for the backend of a &quot;toy&quot; concert manager website, which allowed users to buy tickets, and concert venue managers to create shows with specific seat pricings. The front end was done using React, along with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is a &quot;toy&quot; in the sense that it has all the needed functionality of a website like this, but was reasonably unpolished (particularly on the visual side) and was never used for real concert managers or concertgoers.</p>
<p>For electrical and computer engineering, I've worked with Verilog on FPGAs, and used Cadence for very small chip layouts. As mentioned before, I've also used Altium for my project in High Powered Rocketry Club.</p>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Electrical Engineering Teaching Assistant - Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong><br>
I work as a TA in the lab for ECE2010, an introductory class for circuit analysis and design.<br>
There is no better way to keep your lab skills sharp than having to constantly troubleshoot students' problems, and no better way to make sure you understand every concept fully than having to explain it with clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant - Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong><br>
Before my IQP began in the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant working on a project that looked into applying Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process to optimize particle simulations. In particular the Gaussian Process was used to optimize the placement of a shielding object, and was very applicable to this domain due to the underlying noise of the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Intern - Main Street Music Studios</strong><br>
In the summer of 2023, I interned at Main Street Music Studios in Brewer, Maine. I helped setup equipment for various music artists to produce professional recordings.</p>
