<div class="note">Brief reminder of NMOS from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET>Wikipedia</a>.</div>
<p>Below is a brief visual explanation of how small signal analysis works for MOSFETs intuitively, assuming some basic understanding of what MOSFETs do.</p>
<h3>Gate Voltage on MOSFET</h3>
<p>First, understand that applying a larger gate to source voltage (or source to gate, in a PMOS) to a MOSFET will cause more minority carriers to be drawn through the electric field of the gate to the channel connecting the gate and drain.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual current across the MOSFET from source to drain is dependent on the voltage from drain to source (or source to drain in a PMOS, but from this point forward assume an NMOS for simplicity).</p>
<p>Intuitively, it doesn't matter how &quot;open&quot; the channel across the MOSFET is if there is no voltage drop across it for current to flow.</p>
<h3>Linear and Saturation Region</h3>
<p>With no voltage from drain to source, the MOSFET will be off, but as the voltage across the drain to source becomes large,<br>
the current across the MOSFET flattens. Meaning, after a certain voltage (specifically, $V_{gs}-V_{th}$), the MOSFET begins to act as a current source (no matter the $V_{gs}$, it always supplies a current $I_{dsat}$).[^1] This region is called <em>saturation</em>.<br>
Typically, for small signal analysis, we want the MOSFET to be operating in saturation.</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>This is still a work in progress! In the future, I hope to expand this video to dive deeper into the consequences of this model, and animate what it might look like when your &quot;small signal&quot; is too large, as well as why the equivalent model works.</p>

<p>[^1]: In a non-ideal MOSFET, the current in the saturation region isn't perfectly flat, with a slight upward angle that is approximately linear. This is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_length_modulation">channel length modulation</a>. Instead, the MOSFET can be modeled as a current source with a resistor in parallel to account for this.</p>
